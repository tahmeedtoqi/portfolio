            </h2>
            <p class="texo">
                Growing up in Bangladesh, questions about programming are part of everyday problem solving before you become a CSE student. While many developing countries suffer the consequences of natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts, most - generations of Bangladesh have spent their entire lives avoiding the consequences of the crisis caused by macroeconomic imbalances in our country. Possibly due to this history, it is practically impossible to spend a day of your life without listening to a friend or family member make prediction about what the exchange rate between the taka and the dollar should be, or their opinion about what should be done by the central bank to lower inflation.
                Curiosity to find an answer to these daily questions was what motivated me to start my journey in programming. I was interested in investment tracking and banking applications. In recent years, working as a hobbyist programmer, I have seen first-hand how new technologies and Big Data tools have been transforming the way in which corporate decisions are made. That aroused my curiosity in the different Machine Learning techniques and for that reason I focused on Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain. After that, I was approached by a challenge that gave me the opportunity to unleash my skills in the software development industry in Bangladesh.
                Establishing Magetnabits gave me an incredible opportunity. For the first time in my career, I was able to connect my business ideas with my professional skills. The capable leadership and quickly identified my project management and analytical skills which gave me huge responsibilities. I am currently working closely with the CEO and the amazing team there. During my watch, we closed two strategic deals that are now contributing with more than 10% of the portfolio revenue. It was a hard decision but the challenge of building a start-up and helping they grow and expand globally was an opportunity that I could not decline.
                After establishing Magentabits, I have the opportunity to apply my skills in the AI industry. Bangladesh, where the population suffer the consequences of the absence of good credit, I am extremely excited about our mission of developing software and technologies that make developer life easier.
